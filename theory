Synchronous Generator

Pm is the mechanical power that drives the generator shaft. In real life, this is provided by a turbine.

Vf is the DC voltage applied to the rotor field windings. This voltage, together with the shaft rotation, produces a rotating magnetic field in the rotor.

A, B, C are the three-phase stator terminals. The grid or load is connected from these terminals.

m is the measurement output. Machine speed, currents, angle, torque, etc. are sent to the Bus Selector through this output.

Bus Selector

The Bus Selector is used to extract and analyze specific signals from the complex data bus output of the generator.

Turbine

wref is the reference speed value. It is set to 1 pu, meaning the machine is expected to rotate at nominal speed.

Pref is the reference active power. It is set to 0.75 pu, meaning the generator will produce 75% of its rated power.

we is the electrical speed of the generator. The speed signal from the Bus Selector is connected here.

Peo is the instantaneous electrical power of the generator. It is connected from the Bus Selector.

dw is the speed deviation. It allows the controller to respond to small rotor speed variations.

Speed control: If the generator slows down, the controller detects it and increases the mechanical power.
Power control: If the electrical load increases and the generator is stressed, the controller increases mechanical power to compensate.
Fast response: Small and sudden speed changes (dw) are detected and mechanical power is adjusted accordingly.

Excitation System

Vref is the voltage reference, set to 1 pu.

Vd and Vq are the d- and q-axis components of the generator terminal voltage. The goal is to keep the terminal voltage at nominal value.

These values are used to calculate the terminal voltage, which is compared with the reference voltage Vref.

Vstab is a stabilizing signal to suppress oscillations. Since it is grounded, it is currently inactive.

Vf is the output of this block. It controls rotor magnetization and the output voltage.

The generator output is a 13.8 kV three-phase AC voltage, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.
To transmit power over long distances, a step-up transformer increases the voltage level, reducing transmission losses.

The loads at the generator output represent the plant’s own consumption and a settlement load.

The three-phase fault block intentionally creates a short circuit in the system. Between 0.1–0.2 seconds, the line is short-circuited to ground to test system stability.

The three-phase source represents the grid to which the line is synchronized. Since this grid is very strong, its voltage and frequency are assumed constant.
