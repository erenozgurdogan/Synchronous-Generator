# Synchronous-Generator

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink model designed to evaluate the Transient Stability of a Synchronous Generator connected to a high-voltage grid.Project OverviewThe simulation focuses on the dynamic response of a synchronous machine when subjected to a severe fault condition. The primary goal is to analyze whether the generator can maintain synchronism after the fault is cleared and to observe the damping characteristics of the resulting rotor oscillations.Technical SpecificationsGenerator Parameters: A 3-phase synchronous machine rated at 187 MVA, 13.8 kV (line-to-line), and 60 Hz.Fault Configuration: A Three-Phase-to-Ground (LLL-G) fault is applied—the most severe fault type—with a very low fault resistance ($R_{on} = 0.001\ \Omega$).Fault Timing: The fault is initiated at $t = 1/60$ seconds and cleared at $t = 5/60$ seconds, simulating a 4-cycle transient event.Simulation Method: The Phasor simulation type is utilized to focus on electromechanical oscillations and stability without the computational burden of calculating full sinusoidal wave shapes.
